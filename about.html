        <h2>About My Work</h2>
        <p>My name is Brant Hanneman and I am an artist and graphic designer born and raised in Denver, Colorado. Growing up, I always knew I wanted to pursue something revolving around art in some sense. I have a twin brother who shares the vision and in spring of 2022 we began learning more about illustrator and photoshop. Through doing so, we both developed a style and began sharing our individual portfolios of work for people to see. Ever since, we have both began building our brands for graphic design, which was the birth of VERTIGO222- my graphic design and freelance alias. Ever since, I have been grateful to continue doing what I love and working with hundreds of clients along the way and continuing to learn more with every project. In late 2022, my brother (who's alias is sleepyhouse) and I wanted to focus on creating an extension of our work. This was when we created our clothing brand, Vertigo House. Ever since we were young, we have always been inspired by skate culture, streetwear, and styles that come with. We wanted to create clothing that is unique in our designs and that anyone can wear, and we did just that. We continue to create clothing and work on freelance design work and hope to push the brand further and further as we expand our design knowledge.</p>
